# Differential Equation Solver

## Overview
This program numerically solves ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using three popular methods:

- **Euler Method**  
- **Runge-Kutta Method**  
- **Adams Method**

It also provides visualization of the solution process and compares the numerical results with the exact solution when available. Additionally, the program estimates the computation time for each method.

## Features
- Solve ODEs with user-defined initial conditions.
- Choose between Euler, Runge-Kutta, or Adams methods.
- Visualize approximate and exact solutions on the same graph.
- Measure and display execution time for each method.
- Interactive and easy-to-use interface (CLI or GUI depending on implementation).
